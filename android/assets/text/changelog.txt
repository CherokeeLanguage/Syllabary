Total rewrite.

Re-imaged as "falling blocks into stacks" where you have to get the correct ones
based on supplied challenges.

Start with seven hidden "lives".

Each challenge "cycle", win or lose, the row of "blocks" drops down one level.

If a challenge is not answered correctly within xxx-seconds or is answered
incorrectly you lose a life. If no more lives the session terminates early.

Get as many as you can during xxx-seconds. Any you miss become subtracted points.

At most 14 total or 7 new Syllabary letters per "game session".
4 total tries each letter. 3 correct in a row eliminates 4th try.

At the end of a session, award bonus based on overall extra left.

Then present optional "bonus round" for "old-script" forms. 2 tries each letter.
Max 7 letters total. Keep track of "ability" separately.
Any wrong selection or timeout terminates session.

Points per Syllabary are awarded based on the Leitner box rating and current
session's Pimsleur timings. Game to run in "levels" based on the Leitner box
scores.
