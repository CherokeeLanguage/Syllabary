3.0
Total rewrite.

Re-imaged as "falling blocks into stacks" where you have to get the correct ones
based on supplied challenges.

Each challenge "cycle" the row of "blocks" drops down one level. As game play
progresses should the cycling get faster arcade style?

Incorrectly select Syllabary turn into "Bombs" that explode if they reach bottom
without being correctly chosen. Double bad chosen Syllabary explode.
Bombs are "defused" if they are correctly chosen as Syllabary.

If a bomb explodes.... game over.

Points per Syllabary are awarded based on the Leitner box rating and current
session's Pimsleur timings. Game to run in "levels" based on the Leitner box
scores.
